Here's the list of SPore projects on offer during the **2025 summer break**:

#### Building models for Malaysian Food image classification

- Supervisor: Dr. John See
- Domain: Machine Learning
- Skillsets: Python + ML Library like Tensorflow/PyTorch

_Available for 1-2 students_

> To research and construct machine learning models to classify at least 50 different Malaysian food. Data is available, but this project can update more images and/or more categories. The main aim is to build some ML models for further deployment or demo purposes.

#### UML Class Diagram to Java and vice versa

- Supervisor: Dr. Thomas Basuki
- Domain: Software Engineering
- Skillsets: Java

_Available for 1-2 students_

> To research and build a software that can extract class structure of a Java program and stores it as UML class diagram and vice versa. We will explore UML tools such as UMLet and Java compiler generator such as JavaCC to build the software.

#### Voice Synthesiser

- Supervisor: Dr. Chin Zi Hau
- Domain: Artificial Intelligence
- Skillsets: Python

_Assigned to 1 student_

> This project involves researching and experimenting with GPT-SoVITS, a text-to-speech software for voice training and cloning. Student will train multiple voice models, varying parameters such as dataset length, to analyse and compare the resulting voice quality and characteristics.

#### Automatic on-Browser Video Stream Manipulation

- Supervisor: Dr. John See
- Domain: Full stack development (frontend and backend)
- Skillsets: Python

_Available for 1-2 students_ 

> This project uses WebRTC to transmit real-time audio/video streams over the network via Streamlit library. As a result, we can run video demos (from the webcam) directly on browser, doing cool things like style transfer, avatar augmentation, etc.


#### MyRA Entry Portal

- Supervisor: Dr. Chin Zi Hau
- Domain: Full stack development (frontend and backend)
- Skillsets: -

_Assigned to 1 student_ 

> The current way of compiling researchers' data is by manually compiling spreadsheets submitted by every individual staff.This project is to create a data entry portal and automate certain processes such as researchers' publications and more.

#### Network Topology Simulator

- Supervisor: Dr. Ian Tan
- Domain: Networking
- Skillsets: -

_1 student assigned_

> Building a network topology simulator for demo purposes.
