Here's the list of SPore projects on offer during the **2023 summer break**:

#### Autonomous Drone Piloting

- Supervisor: Dr. John See
- Domain: Software/App Development, Artificial Intelligence

_Available for 2 students_

> It is now possible to program drones to self-navigate, which in turn leads to many interesting possibilities. This project aims to explore and develop simple autonomous drone piloting, which can be achieved via numerous ways, e.g. voice control, gesture control or marker-based detection, or a combination. One interesting application can be built to demonstrate the drone's navigational capabilities.

#### Virtual Fashion Assistant

- Supervisor: Dr. Chit Su Mon
- Domain: Software/App Development

_Available for 2-3 students_

> A virtual fashion assistant app is a software application that helps users with their fashion choices and provides styling recommendations. The app can be designed to assist users in selecting clothing and accessories that match their preferences, body type, and occasion. The app can use user preferences, browsing history, and social media activity to provide personalized recommendations. The app can include features such as a virtual wardrobe, where users can upload photos of their clothing and accessories, and the app can suggest different outfit combinations. It can also provide styling tips and fashion advice through articles and videos (optional).

#### Palm Kernel Multi-Class Classifier

- Supervisor: Dr. Ian Tan
- Domain: Artificial Intelligence

_Available. 2 students_

> Most image classifiers on palm kernel fresh fruit bunch (FFB) are binary classifiers with a few past work on 3 class classifier.  The actual number of classifications for FFB are beyond 3 classes.  The project here requires manual dataset preparation (label and archjve) from an actual palm oil mill, and to use existing pre-trained image classifier models for multi-class classification.

#### Animating 3D Objects with Blender and Python

- Supervisor: Dr. John See
- Domain: Software/App Development

_Available for 2 students_

> Blender, a popular 3D computer graphics software allows for Python scripting to encourage creative coders to create procedural artwork. In other words, Python scripts can be used to animate geometry of 3D objects and models, morph and distort them, and incorporate user interactions. This project explores the fundamental pipeline of creating animated 3D objects via Blender and Python.

#### Underwater Image Enhancement

- Supervisor: Dr. John See
- Domain: Computer Vision, Machine Learning

_Available for 1 student_ (_+1 collaborating student from Ocean University, China_)

> Image enhancement is a challenge in computer vision based underwater imaging due to the degradation of image quality in the underwater environment. Due to the light scattering and absorption effect in such environments, images often suffer from low visibilities, blurry effects and color variations. This project explores several viable solutions to achieve this task, motivated by the acquisition of newly collected data.
