Here's the list of SPOre projects on offer during the current 2022 summer break (in no particular order).

#### Programmable Drone Control

Supervisor: Dr. John See

Domain: Artificial Intelligence

_Available. Team of 2 students_

> Drone flying is becoming very popular both as a hobby and for more serious work such as aerial monitoring. This project aims to explore programmable drone control to automatically perform a series of movements. This can be achieved by gesture control or marker detection or a combination of both. What can these programmed drones be used for? The sky's the limit.

#### Recommender System

Supervisor: Dr. Ian Tan

Domain: Data Science

_Available. 1 student_

> Joke recommendation from the Jester dataset using the Python Surprise package methods (and beyond).  The project will start with the understanding of matrix factorisation, and an opportunity to extend from there.

#### Palm Kernel Multi-Class Classifier

Supervisor: Dr. Ian Tan

Domain: Artificial Intelligence

_Available. 2 students_

> Most image classifiers on palm kernel fresh fruit bunch (FFB) are binary classifiers with a few past work on 3 class classifier.  The actual number of classifications for FFB are beyond 3 classes.  The project here requires manual dataset preparation (label and archjve) from an actual palm oil mill, and to use existing pre-trained image classifier models for multi-class classification.

#### Opinion Mining from Short Text for Online Products

Supervisor: Dr. Ian Tan

Domain: Data Science

_Available. 2 students_

> Customers may leave ratings and short comments for the products they have purchased.  Using the large Amazon product dataset with ratings and comments, this project is to either train a model for opinion (sentiment), and/or to use an existing library such as the Python (or R) Vader package.

#### Visual Traveller

Supervisor: Dr. John See

Domain: Software Development & Data Science

_Available. 2 students_

> I wonder what's really interesting to see and do in Putrajaya... In this project, try curating interesting photos and videos of a certain vicinity from social media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok and display them in a cool and fun way (on top of a map, using a timeline, and more), suitable for the keen and curious traveller.

#### Emojibot

Supervisor: Dr. John See

Domain: Artificial Intelligence

_Available. 2 students_

> Most of us use emojis everyday when conversing with others in the virtual world. But can we get computers to "decorate" our text with the right choice of emojis? Can  the computers even respond accordingly with the right type of emoji 😹🔥❤️ ?

#### IoT for Agriculture

Supervisor: Dr. Rosalind

Domain: IoT/Embedded Systems

_Available. 2-3 students_

> IoT based systems make use of sensors to receive feedback from the environment. This project prototypes a system that uses various IoT sensors to collect data such as moisture levels in the soil, temperature, etc. which in turn, allows the system to better understand the utilisation of resources (water, electricity). The collected data can also be archived for future reference and decision-making.
