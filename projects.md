#### Palm Kernel Multi-Class Classifier

- Supervisor: Dr. Ian Tan
- Domain: Artificial Intelligence

_Available. 2 students_

> Most image classifiers on palm kernel fresh fruit bunch (FFB) are binary classifiers with a few past work on 3 class classifier.  The actual number of classifications for FFB are beyond 3 classes.  The project here requires manual dataset preparation (label and archjve) from an actual palm oil mill, and to use existing pre-trained image classifier models for multi-class classification.
