excerpt: "SPOre is a HWUM MACS initiative to provide undergraduate computing and data science students an early opportunity to experience project work and brew new innovative ideas, under the guidance of a supervisor or research group. The SPOre programme runs through the summer break (June to August), where students will acquire a spectrum of skills that supplements their existing knowledge before undertaking larger projects (like final year project) or joining internship stints. SPOre is modelled after the popularly known UROP programmes found in many leading universities, with the exception that it is open to both research-oriented and development-oriented projects."

SPOre is a HWUM MACS initiative to provide undergraduate computing and data science students an early opportunity to experience project work and brew new innovative ideas, under the guidance of a supervisor or research group. The SPOre programme runs through the summer break (June to August), where students will acquire a spectrum of skills that supplements their existing knowledge before undertaking larger projects (like final year project) or joining internship stints.

SPOre is modelled after the popularly known UROP programmes found in [many](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/undergraduate-research-opportunities-programme-urop){:target="_blank"} [leading](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mse/admissions/undergraduates/current-students/research-scheme/urop){:target="_blank"} [universities](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop){:target="_blank"}, with the exception that SPOre is open to both research-centric (R) and development-centric (D) projects.

### How to join

Look at the list of [projects](/projects/). If anything piques your interest, drop the supervisor an email. Note that most projects are team-based (more than 1 person involved). The supervisor may have multiple applicants for a particular project and could recommend teaming up students, or providing other available options if one is already filled. We will update the project availability on the website as often as we could.

Currently, projects in SPOre are primarily focused with _computing_ at its core, and are designed for CS students. However, these projects (if suitable) are also opened to undergraduate students of any related programme in HWUM. Students will be awarded a certificate upon successful completion of the project.

A short briefing session is planned soon to provide further information about the SPOre programme.
