excerpt: "SPOre is a HWUM MACS initiative to provide undergraduate computing and data science students an early opportunity to experience project work and brew new innovative ideas, under the guidance of a supervisor or research group. The SPOre programme runs through the summer break (June to August), where students can acquire a spectrum of skills that supplements their existing knowledge before undertaking larger projects (like group-based projects or final year project) or joining internship stints. SPOre is modelled after the popularly known UROP programmes found in many leading universities, with the exception that it is open to both research-oriented and development-oriented projects."

SPOre is a HWUM MACS initiative to provide undergraduate computing and data science students an early opportunity to experience project work and brew new innovative ideas, under the guidance of a supervisor or research group. The SPOre programme runs through the summer break (June to August) for roughly 10-12 weeks, where students can acquire a spectrum of skills that supplements their existing knowledge before undertaking larger projects (like final year project) or joining internship stints.

SPOre is modelled after the popularly known UROP programmes found in [many](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/undergraduate-research-opportunities-programme-urop){:target="_blank"} [leading](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mse/admissions/undergraduates/current-students/research-scheme/urop){:target="_blank"} [universities](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop){:target="_blank"}, with the exception that SPOre is opened to both research-centric (R) and development-centric (D) projects.

### How to join

Look at the list of [available projects](/projects/). If anything piques your interest, drop the supervisor an email. Note that most projects are team-based (more than 1 person involved). The supervisor may have multiple applicants for a particular project and could recommend teaming up students, or providing other available options if one is already filled. We will update the project availability on the website as often as we could.

Currently, projects in SPOre are primarily focused with _computing_ at its core, and are designed for CS students. However, these projects (if feasible) are also opened to undergraduate students of other related programmes in HWUM such as Statistical Data Science, whereby the project has to be led by a CS student.
