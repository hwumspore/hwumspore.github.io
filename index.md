excerpt: "SPOre is a HWUM MACS initiative to provide undergraduate computing and data science students an early opportunity to experience project work and brew new innovative ideas, under the guidance of a supervisor or research group. The SPOre programme runs through the summer break (June to August), where students will acquire a spectrum of skills that supplements their existing knowledge before undertaking larger projects (like final year project) or joining internship stints. SPOre is modelled after the popularly known UROP programmes found in many leading universities, with the exception that it is open to both research-oriented and development-oriented projects."

SPOre is a HWUM MACS initiative to provide undergraduate computing and data science students an early opportunity to experience project work and brew new innovative ideas, under the guidance of a supervisor or research group. The SPOre programme runs through the summer break (June to August), where students will acquire a spectrum of skills that supplements their existing knowledge before undertaking larger projects (like final year project) or joining internship stints. SPOre is modelled after the popularly known UROP programmes found in many leading universities, with the exception that it is open to both research-oriented and development-oriented projects.

### How to join

Look at the list of projects (below). If anything piques your interest, drop the supervisor an email. Note that most projects are team-based (more than 1 person involved). The supervisor may have multiple applicants for a particular project and could recommend teaming up students, or providing other available options if one is already filled. We would try to update the project availability on the website as often as we could.

Currently, projects in SPOre are primarily focused with _computing_ at its core, and are designed for CS students. However, these projects (if suitable) are also opened to undergraduate students of any related programme in HWUM.

A short briefing session is planned soon to provide further information about the SPOre programme.

### FAQs

**How long does a project last?**
Typically, a project would last for a duration of 8 to 10 weeks, between June to August. The starting date varies from project to project (please check with the supervisor but usually it can start anytime as agreed with the supervisor!).

**What do I need to submit or deliver for the project?**
As this is a non-credit-bearing programme, there is absolutely no assessment (of any form) at all. What we do need is your _commitment_ to the project (you will probably be getting a certificate at the end of the project), and perhaps a simple _demo_ and/or _presentation_ to sum up your work and experience. We plan to also feature your project write-up on our webpage, and we would like you to blog or _share_ to your social networks!

**Do I need to meet my supervisor face-to-face regularly?**
This depends on your arrangement with the supervisor, with consideration for the nature of the project (whether face-to-face meet-up is necessary to demonstrate the problem, or to examine the work). Naturally, the supervisor would be providing most of the guidance

**The project says only 2 members. Can we have another person joining the project?**
The supervisor of the project probably had in mind that the project scope is suitable for 2 persons. However, your team can discuss with the supervisor if adding another person to the project is possible - in that case, the project scope should be broadened to include more persons. We would like all students to be actively participating in the project!

**What are the benefits of joining SPOre?**
If you had a summer break of 2-3 months to spare, use this as an opportunity to learn new coding or problem-solving skills, learn to manage projects in a timely manner, learn to work in a team, and more. More importantly, use it as a platform to discover what you really like doing. On top of that, your project could also be a nice addition to your resume!
