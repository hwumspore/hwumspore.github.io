Here's some frequently-asked questions about the SPOre programme:

**How long does a project last?**
Typically, a project would last for a duration of 8 to 10 weeks, between June to August. The starting date varies from project to project (please check with the supervisor but usually it can start anytime as agreed with the supervisor!).

**What do I need to submit or deliver for the project?**
As this is a non-credit-bearing programme, there is absolutely no assessment (of any form) at all. What we do need is your _commitment_ to the project (you will probably be getting a certificate at the end of the project), and perhaps a simple _demo_ and/or _presentation_ to sum up your work and experience. We plan to also feature your project write-up on our webpage, and we would like you to blog or _share_ to your social networks!

**Do I need to meet my supervisor face-to-face regularly?**
This depends on your arrangement with the supervisor, with consideration for the nature of the project (whether face-to-face meet-up is necessary to demonstrate the problem, or to examine the work). Owing to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions in universities nationwide, we encourage more face-to-face sessions for better communications.

**The project says only 2 members. Can we have another person joining the project?**
The supervisor of the project probably had in mind that the project scope is suitable for 2 persons. However, your team can discuss with the supervisor if adding another person to the project is possible - in that case, the project scope should be broadened to include more persons. We would like all students to be actively participating in the project!

**What are the benefits of joining SPOre?**
If you have a summer break of 2-3 months to spare, use this as an opportunity to learn new coding or a new domain of knowledge, learn to manage projects in a timely manner, learn to work in a team, and more. More importantly, use it as a platform to discover what you really like doing. On top of that, your project could also be a nice addition to your resume!
